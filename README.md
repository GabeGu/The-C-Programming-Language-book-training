# The-C-Programming-Language-book-training

This repo is for the Examples and Exercises' codes in the book <The C Programming Language> 2nd Edition by K&R.
These codes are generated as learning this book to make me more understanding the knowledge points, so as the 
book said:"the way to learn new language is to write programs in it", even although I have use the c language for 
many years on my work. It makes me more confidence about this language. at the same time, I hope this training codes
may help you, and be free to ask the questions about these codes for we must have different understanding and implementation
methods.
        
These codes are compiled and run in those environment:

* OS: windows 10
* Editor: Visual Studio Code 1.32.3 + C/C++ Compile Run extension
* Compiler: MinGW.org GCC-8.2.0-3
            
Every example and exercise source code is named with prefix "example" or "exercise" and the chapter number from the book 
for quick search.
